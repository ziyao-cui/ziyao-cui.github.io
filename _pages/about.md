Hello! I'm Ziyao (Richard) Cui, an undergraduate at <a href="https://cs.duke.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duke University</a> studying Computer Science (AI/ML concentration), Statistical Science (Data Science concentration), and Economics. I study how machine learning models communicate, particularly how knowledge is transferred and modified during processes like knowledge distillation. My research aims to uncover how these mechanisms affect uncertainty, privacy, and robustness, ultimately advancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of AI systems.

Iâ€™ve been fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jpei/jian-peis-homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Jian Pei</a>, <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Cynthia Rudin</a>, and <a href="https://www.edrictam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Edric Tam</a> during my time at Duke. In Spring 2025, I had the privilege of studying at the <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Oxford</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/seth.flaxman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Seth Flaxman</a> and <a href="https://mlgh.net/author/sahoko-ishida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Sahoko Ishida</a> as a part of the <a href="https://mlgh.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning & Global Health Network</a> on the intersection of computer vision and statistical modeling for food security.
